/**
 * BehavioralFeature class proxy interface. A behavioral feature refers to a dynamic feature of a model element, such as
 * an operation or method. In the metamodel, BehavioralFeature specifies a behavioral aspect of a Classifier. All
 * different kinds of behavioral aspects of a Classifier, such as Operation and Method, are subclasses of
 * BehavioralFeature. BehavioralFeature is an abstract metaclass.
