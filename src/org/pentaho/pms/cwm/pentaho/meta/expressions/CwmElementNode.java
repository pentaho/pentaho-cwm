 * ElementNode object instance interface. An ElementNode is a node in an expression that references some ModelElement

 * Feature and cannot, therefore, be represented as a FeatureNode. Typically, use of this subclass of ExpressionNode
 * implies that a tool attemp ting to evaluate the expression will be able to determine if the referenced ModelElement
 * instance is also an instance of some interesting subclass of ModelEle ment that contains a value of interest in the
 * expression.
