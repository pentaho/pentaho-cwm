/**
 * ExpressionNode class proxy interface. All node types within an expression are derived from the ExpressionNode type.
 * An expression is stored as a collection of instances of the subtypes of ExpressionNode arranged in a hierarchical
 * fashion. The ExpressionNode instan ce at the top (or ?root?) of the hierarchy represents the value of the ex pression
 * and serves as a starting point for expression evaluation. Refer to the descriptions of the subtypes of ExpressionNode
 * (ElementNode, Const antNode, and FeatureNode) for additional information about the representat ion of expressions.
 * One important purpose for providing storage of expressions as a general feature of the CWM is to promote sharing them
 * between tools and to provide a means for recording lineage relationships between components within expr essions.
 * Specific details of the implementation of expression operators a re left to the implementing tools. When
 * ExpressionNode is used as the type of an Attribute, an instance of the Attribute can contain either an expression
 * tree as described here or a t extual representation of the expression in body and language values of in an attribute
 * of type Expression (defined ObjectModel). The expression at tribute is provided for the latter usage. To obtain CWM?s
 * sharing and lin eage tracking features for elements within an expression, the expression m ust be represented as an
 * expression hierarcy.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
