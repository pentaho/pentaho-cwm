/**
 * ExpressionNode object instance interface. All node types within an expression are derived from the ExpressionNode
 * type. An expression is stored as a collection of instances of the subtypes of ExpressionNode arranged in a
 * hierarchical fashion. The ExpressionNode instan ce at the top (or ?root?) of the hierarchy represents the value of
 * the ex pression and serves as a starting point for expression evaluation. Refer to the descriptions of the subtypes
 * of ExpressionNode (ElementNode, Const antNode, and FeatureNode) for additional information about the representat ion
 * of expressions. One important purpose for providing storage of expressions as a general feature of the CWM is to
 * promote sharing them between tools and to provide a means for recording lineage relationships between components
 * within expr essions. Specific details of the implementation of expression operators a re left to the implementing
 * tools. When ExpressionNode is used as the type of an Attribute, an instance of the Attribute can contain either an
 * expression tree as described here or a t extual representation of the expression in body and language values of in an
 * attribute of type Expression (defined ObjectModel). The expression at tribute is provided for the latter usage. To
 * obtain CWM?s sharing and lin eage tracking features for elements within an expression, the expression m ust be
 * represented as an expression hierarcy.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
