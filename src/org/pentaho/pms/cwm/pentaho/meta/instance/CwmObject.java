/**
 * Object object instance interface. An object is an instance that originates from a class. In the metamodel, Object is
 * a subclass of Instance originating from a Clas s. The Class may be modified dynamically, which means that the set of
 * fea tures of the Object may change during its life-time. An object is an instance that originates from a class; it is
 * structured an d behaves according to its class. All objects originating from the same c lass are structured in the
 * same way, although each of them has its own set o f attribute slots. Each attribute slot references an instance,
 * usually a da ta value or possibly, another object. The number of attribute slots wit h the same name fulfills the
 * multiplicity of the corresponding attribute in the class. The set may be modified according to the specification in
 * the corresponding attribute, e.g. each referenced instance must origina te from (a specialization of) the type of the
 * attribute, and attribute slots may be added or removed according to the changeable property of the attribute.
 *
