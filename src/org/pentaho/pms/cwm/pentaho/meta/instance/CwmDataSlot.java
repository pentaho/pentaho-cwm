 * value or a number. The dataValue (and dataType where set) must be consistent with the type of the DataSlot's feature
 * (Attribute) and must obey any constraints on the full descriptor of the Attribute's DataType (including both explicit
 * constraints and built-in constraints such as multiplicity).
