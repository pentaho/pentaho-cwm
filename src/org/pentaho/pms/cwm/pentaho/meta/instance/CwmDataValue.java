 * DataValue object instance interface. A data value is an instance with no identity. In the metamodel, DataValue is a
 * child of Instance that cannot change its state, i.e. all operations that are applicable to it are pure functions or
 * queries that do not cause any side effects. DataValues are typically used as attribute values. Since it is not
 * possible to differentiate between two data values that app ear to be the same, it becomes more of a philosophical
 * issue whether ther e are several data values representing the same value or just one for each value. In addition, a
 * data value cannot change its data type and it does no t have contained instances.

 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented
