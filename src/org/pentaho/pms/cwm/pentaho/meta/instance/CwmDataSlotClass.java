 * DataSlot class proxy interface. A Slot which is used to hold a data value where there is no need to manage the value
 * as an element in its own right (in which case a DataValue would be used) - for example it is a one-off string value
 * or a number. The dataValue (and dataType where set) must be consistent with the type of the DataSlot's feature
 * (Attribute) and must obey any constraints on the full descriptor of the Attribute's DataType (including both explicit
 * constraints and built-in constraints such as multiplicity).

 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented
