 * DataValue class proxy interface. A data value is an instance with no identity. In the metamodel, DataValue is a child
 * of Instance that cannot change its state, i.e. all operations that are applicable to it are pure functions or queries
 * that do not cause any side effects. DataValues are typically used as attribute values. Since it is not possible to
 * differentiate between two data values that app ear to be the same, it becomes more of a philosophical issue whether
 * ther e are several data values representing the same value or just one for each value. In addition, a data value
 * cannot change its data type and it does no t have contained instances.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
