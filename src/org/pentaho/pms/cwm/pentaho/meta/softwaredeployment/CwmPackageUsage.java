 * PackageUsage object instance interface. A PackageUsage represents a usage of a Package. It is particularly relevant

 * recorded using the packageAlias attribute. For example, if a DataProvider representing an ODBC or JDBC client uses a
 * na me for a relational database that is different from the dataPackage name used b y the RDBMS server, a PackageUsage
 * that has the relevant ProviderConnection as client and the server?s data Package as supplier can be added. Its pa
 * ckageAlias attribute can be used to record the name by which the data Pa ckage is known to the DataProvider.
