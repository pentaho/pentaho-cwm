/**
 * PackageUsage class proxy interface. A PackageUsage represents a usage of a Package. It is particularly relevant in
 * situations where a specific usage uses an alternative name for the Package, as this alternative name can be recorded
 * using the packageAlias attribute. For example, if a DataProvider representing an ODBC or JDBC client uses a na me for
 * a relational database that is different from the dataPackage name used b y the RDBMS server, a PackageUsage that has
 * the relevant ProviderConnection as client and the server?s data Package as supplier can be added. Its pa ckageAlias
 * attribute can be used to record the name by which the data Pa ckage is known to the DataProvider.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
