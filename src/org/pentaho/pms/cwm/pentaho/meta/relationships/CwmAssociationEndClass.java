/**
 * AssociationEnd class proxy interface. An association end is an endpoint of an association, which connects the
 * association to a classifier. Each association end is part of one association. The association ends of each
 * association are ordered. In the metamodel, an AssociationEnd is part of an Association and specif ies the connection
 * of an Association to some other Classifier. Because Associa tionEnds are a kind of StructuralFeature, they are owned
 * and ordered by A ssociation instances via the ClassifierFeature association. The Structura lFeatureType association
 * is used to identify the Classifier to which the AssociationEnd is attached. Each AssociationEnd has a name and
 * defines a set of properties of the connection. The multiplicity property of an association end specifies how many
 * insta nces of the classifier at a given end (the one bearing the multiplicity value) may be associated with a single
 * instance of the classifier at the other end. The association end also states whether or not the connection may be
 * traversed towards the instance playing that role in the connection (the isNavigable attribute), that is, if the
 * instance is directly reachable via the association.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>

  /**
   * Creates an instance object having attributes initialized by the passed values.
   * 
   * @param name
   *          An identifier for the ModelElement within its containing Namespace.
   * @param visibility
   *          Specifies extent of the visibility of the ModelElement within its owning Namespace.
   * @param ownerScope
   *          Specifies whether the Feature appears in every instance of the Classifier or whether it appears only once
   *          for the entire Classifier.
   * @param changeability
   *          Specifies whether the value may be modified after the object is created.
   * @param multiplicity
   *          The possible number of data values for the feature that may be held by an instance. The cardinality of the
   *          set of values is an implicit part of the feature. In the common case in which the multiplicity is 1..1,
   *          then the feature is a scalar (i.e., it holds exactly one value).
   * @param ordering
   *          Specifies whether the set of instances is ordered. The ordering must be determined and maintained by
   *          Operations that add values to the feature. This property is only relevant if the multiplicity is greater
   *          than one.
   * @param targetScope
   *          Specifies whether the targets are ordinary Instances or are Classifiers.
   * @param aggregation
   *          When placed on one end (the "target" end), specifies whether the class on the target end is an aggregation
   *          with respect to the class on the other end (the "source" end). Only one end of an association can be an
   *          aggregation.
   * @param isNavigable
   *          When placed on a target end, specifies whether traversal from a source instance to its associated target
   *          instances is possible. A value of true means that the association can be navigated by the source class and
   *          the target rolename can be used in navigation expressions. Specification of navigability for each
   *          direction is defined independently.
   * @return The created instance object.
