  /**
   * Creates an instance object having attributes initialized by the passed values.
   * 
   * @param name
   *          An identifier for the ModelElement within its containing Namespace.
   * @param visibility
   *          Specifies extent of the visibility of the ModelElement within its owning Namespace.
   * @param ownerScope
   *          Specifies whether the Feature appears in every instance of the Classifier or whether it appears only once
   *          for the entire Classifier.
   * @param changeability
   *          Specifies whether the value may be modified after the object is created.
   * @param multiplicity
   *          The possible number of data values for the feature that may be held by an instance. The cardinality of the
   *          set of values is an implicit part of the feature. In the common case in which the multiplicity is 1..1,
   *          then the feature is a scalar (i.e., it holds exactly one value).
   * @param ordering
   *          Specifies whether the set of instances is ordered. The ordering must be determined and maintained by
   *          Operations that add values to the feature. This property is only relevant if the multiplicity is greater
   *          than one.
   * @param targetScope
   *          Specifies whether the targets are ordinary Instances or are Classifiers.
   * @param initialValue
   *          An Expression specifying the value of the attribute upon initialization. It is meant to be evaluated at
   *          the time the object is initialized. (Note that an explicit constructor may supersede an initial value.)
   * @return The created instance object.
