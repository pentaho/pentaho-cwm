/**
 * Package class proxy interface. A package is a grouping of model elements. In the metamodel, Package is a subclass of
 * Namespace. A Package contains ModelElements such as Packages and Classifiers. A Package may also contain Constraints
 * and Dependencies between ModelElements of the Package. The purpose of the package construct is to provide a general
 * grouping mec hanism. In fact, its only semantics is to define a namespace for its conten ts. The package construct
 * can be used for organizing elements for any pur pose; the criteria to use for grouping elements together into one
 * package ar e not defined. A package owns a set of model elements, with the implication that if the package is removed
 * from the model, so are the elements owned by the package . Elements with names, such as classifiers, that are owned
 * by the same pa ckage must have unique names within the package, although elements in differ ent packages may have the
 * same name. There may be relationships between elements contained in the same package , and between an element in one
 * package and an element in a surrounding pac kage at any level. In other words, elements ?see? all the way out through
 * nested levels of packages. Elements in peer packages, however, are encapsulated and are not a priori visible to each
 * other. The same goes for elements in contained packages, i .e. packages do not see "inwards". Elements owned by a
 * Package can be made available to other Packages by im porting them. Although any ModelElement may be imported by a
 * Package, imported ModelElements are typically other Packages. When an element is imported b y a package it extends
 * the namespace of that package. Thus the elements avail able in a Package consists of its owned and imported
 * ModelElements.
