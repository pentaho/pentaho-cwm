/**
 * Dependency class proxy interface. A dependency states that the implementation or functioning of one or more elements
 * requires the presence of one or more other elements. In the metamodel, a Dependency is a directed relationship from a
 * client (o r clients) to a supplier (or suppliers) stating that the client is dependent on t he supplier (i.e., the
 * client element requires the presence and knowledg e of the supplier element). A dependency specifies that the
 * semantics of a set of model elements requi res the presence of another set of model elements. This implies that if
 * the sourc e is somehow modified, the dependents probably must be modified. The rea son for the dependency can be
 * specified in several different ways (e.g., usin g natural language or an algorithm) but is often implicit. Whenever
 * the supplier element of a dependency changes, the client element is potentially invalidated. After such invalidation,
 * a check should be performed followed by possible changes to the derived client element. Such a check should be
 * performed after which action can be taken to change the derived el ement to validate it again.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
