/**
 * Namespace class proxy interface. A namespace is a part of a model that contains a set of ModelElements each of whose
 * names designates a unique element within the namespace. In the metamodel, a Namespace is a ModelElement that can own
 * other ModelEle ments, such as Classifiers. The name of each owned ModelElement must be un ique within the Namespace.
 * Moreover, each contained ModelElement is owned b y at most one Namespace. The concrete subclasses of Namespace may
 * have a dditional constraints on which kind of elements may be contained. Namespace is an abstract metaclass. Note
 * that explicit parts of a model element, such as the features of a Clas sifier, are not modeled as owned elements in a
 * namespace. A namespace is u sed for unstructured contents such as the contents of a package, or a clas s declared
 * inside the scope of another class.
 *

 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
