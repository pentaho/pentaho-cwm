/**
 * Constraint object instance interface. A constraint is a semantic condition or restriction expressed in text. In the
 * metamodel, a Constraint is a BooleanExpression on an associated M odelElement(s) which must be true for the model to
 * be well formed. This restriction can be stated in natural language, or in different kinds of languages with
 * well-defined semantics. Certain Constraints are predefine d, others may be user defined. Note that a Constraint is an
 * assertion, not an executable mechanism. The specification is written as an expression in a designated constraint
 * language. The language can be specially designed for writing constrain ts (such as OCL), a programming language,
 * mathematical notation, or natur al language. If constraints are to be enforced by a model editor tool, t hen the tool
 * must understand the syntax and semantics of the constraint lan guage. Because the choice of language is arbitrary,
 * constraints can be u sed as an extension mechanism. The constraint concept allows new semantics to be specified
 * linguistical ly for a model element. In the metamodel a Constraint directly attached to a ModelElement describes
 * semantic restrictions that this ModelElement must obey.
