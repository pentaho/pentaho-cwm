/**
 * Stereotype object instance interface. The stereotype concept provides a way of branding (classifying) model elements
 * so that they behave as if they were instances of new virtual metamodel constructs. These model elements have the same
 * structure (attributes, associations, operations) as similar non-stereotyped model elements of the same kind. The
 * stereotype may specify additional constraints and required tagged values that apply to model elements. In addition, a
 * stereotype may be used to indicate a difference in meaning or usage between two model elements with identical
 * structure. In the metamodel the Stereotype metaclass is a subclass of ModelElement. Tagged Values and Constraints
 * attached to a Stereotype apply to all ModelElem ents branded by that Stereotype. A stereotype keeps track of the base
 * class to which it may be applied. The base class is a class in the metamodel (not a user-level modeling element) such
 * as Class, Association, etc. If a model element is branded by an attached stereo type, then the CWM base class of the
 * model element must be the base clas s specified by the stereotype or one of the subclasses of that base class.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
