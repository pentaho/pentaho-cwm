/**
 * Model class proxy interface. A model captures a view of a physical system. It is an abstraction of the physical
 * system, with a certain purpose. The model completely describes those aspects of the physical system that are relevant
 * to the purpose of the model, at the appropriate level of detail. In the metamodel, Model is a subclass of Package. It
 * contains a containmen t hierarchy of ModelElements that together describe the physical system. A Model also contains
 * a set of ModelElements that represents the environ ment of the system. Different Models can be defined for the same
 * physical system, where each m odel represents a view of the physical system defined by its purpose and abstraction
 * level, e.g. an analysis model, a design model, an implementa tion model. Typically different models are complementary
 * and defined fro m the perspectives (viewpoints) of different system stakeholders.
