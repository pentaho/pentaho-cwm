/**
 * Class object instance interface. A class is a description of a set of objects that share the same attributes,
 * operations, methods, relationships, and semantics. A class may use a set of interfaces to specify collections of
 * operations it provides to its environment. In the metamodel, a Class describes a set of objects sharing a collection
 * of Features that are common to the set of objects. The purpose of a Class is to declare a collection of Features that
 * fully desc ribe the structure and behavior of objects. Some Classes may not be direc tly instantiated. These Classes
 * are said to be abstract and exist only for other Cl asses to inherit and reuse the Features declared by them. No
 * object may be a direct instance of an abstract Class, although an object may be an indir ect instance of one through
 * a subclass that is non-abstract. A Class acts as the namespace for various kinds of contained elements defined within
 * its scope, including classes, interfaces and associations (note t hat this is purely a scoping construction and does
 * not imply anything about aggrega tion). The contained classes can be used as ordinary classes in the contai ner
 * class. If a class inherits another class, the contents of the ancestor are available to its descendents if the
 * visibility of an element is publi c or protected; however, if the visibility is private, then the element is not
 * visible and therefore not available in the descendant.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
