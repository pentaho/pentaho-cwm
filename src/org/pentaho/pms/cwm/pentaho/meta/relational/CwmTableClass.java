   * Creates an instance object having attributes initialized by the passed values.

   * @param name
   *          An identifier for the ModelElement within its containing Namespace.
   * @param visibility
   *          Specifies extent of the visibility of the ModelElement within its owning Namespace.
   * @param isAbstract
   *          An abstract Classifier is not instantiable.
   * @param isTemporary
   *          Indicates that the table content is temporary. SQL92 standards provide two types of temporary tables
   *          (local Temporary and Global Temporary). However, RDBMS products have implemented variations on this theme.
   *          It is recommended that the product manufacturers provide specific temporary information (besides the
   *          temporaryScope attribute) in their extensions.
   * @param temporaryScope
   *          This attribute is meaningful only when the isTemporary flag is True [C-1]. The scope indicates when the
   *          data of this table are available. "SESSION", "APPLICATION" are examples of possible values. Look at the
   *          Scope attribute for Global Temporary tables in the SQL standards for more details.
   * @param isSystem
   *          Indicates that the Table is a System Table (generally part of or view on the system catalog).
   * @return The created instance object.
