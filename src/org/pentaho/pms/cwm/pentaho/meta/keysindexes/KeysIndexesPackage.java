/**
 * KeysIndexes package interface. The KeysIndexes package depends on the following package:
 * org.omg::CWM::ObjectModel::Core Keys and indexes as means for specifying instances and for identifying alternate
 * sortings of ins tances are epresented in the CWMFoundation so that they can be shared among the various data models
 * that employ hem. The CWM Foundation define s the base concepts (uniqueness and relationships implemented as keys) pon
 * which more specific key structures can be built by other CWM and tool- specific packages. The concepts of key and
 * index have been placed in the CWM Foundation because they are available in many types of data resources. In the CWM
 * Foundation class and assoc iation descriptions that follow, relational model examples are frequent ly used when
 * discussing the definition and usage of key and index types . This is done because of the wide-spread availability of
 * relational system s and is thought to promote an understanding of the underlying concepts. T hese concepts, however,
 * are no less applicable to other data models as w ell. The two central classes for representing the concept of keys
 * are UniqueKey and KeyRelationship. UniqueKey instances correspond to the notion that keys represent the id entity of
 * instances -- similar to the relational model?s concept of a pr imary key or an object model?s concept of an object
 * identity. In contra st, KeyRelationship instancescorrespond to the notion that keys embedded in an instance can be
 * used to determine the identity of other related instan ces -- similar to the relational model concept of foreign key
 * and the ob ject model concept of a reference. Consequently, UniqueKey and KeyRelations hip are best thought of as
 * representing roles that collections of Features of Clas sifiers play rather than Classifiers describing the internal
 * structure of ke ys. Representing keys as roles rather than structural entities provides g reater flexibility and
 * allows the reuse of Features in multiple keys and in differing relationships to each other. Associations within the
 * KeysIndexes package describe how UniqueKey and KeyRelationship instances describe the roles they play for various
 * Class instances and the StructuralFeature instances they contain. OCL Representation of KeysIndexes Constraints
