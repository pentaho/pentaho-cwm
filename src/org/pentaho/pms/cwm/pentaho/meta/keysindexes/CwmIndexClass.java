/**
 * Index class proxy interface. Instances of the Index class represent the ordering of the instances of some other
 * Class, and the Index is said to "span" the Class. Indexes normally have an ordered set of attributes of the Class
 * instance they span that make up the "key" of the index; this set of relationships is represented by the
 * IndexedFeature class that indicates how the attributes are used by the Index instance. The Index class is intended
 * primarily as a starting point for tools that require the notion of an index.
