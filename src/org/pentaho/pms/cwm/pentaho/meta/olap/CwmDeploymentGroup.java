 * DeploymentGroup object instance interface. DeploymentGroup represents a logical grouping of model elements defining a
 * single, complete deployment of an instance of Olap Schema (i.e., CubeDeployments and DimensionDeployments). The usage
 * of DeploymentGroup is as follows: A user may specify a particul ar DeploymentGroup as the session-wide, default
 * deployment for all metadata queries performed throughout the session. Alternatively, for queries involving some
 * particular deployed object (e.g., a Cube or a Dimension), the user may b e asked to choose from a list of
 * deployments. This either becomes the default deploy ment for the remainder of the session, or the user may continue
 * to be a sked to specify a deployment for each subsequent query against deployed ob jects.
 *
