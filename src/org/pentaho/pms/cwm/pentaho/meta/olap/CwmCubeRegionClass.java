/**
 * CubeRegion class proxy interface. CubeRegion models a sub-unit of a Cube of the same dimensionality as the Cube
 * itself, with each Dimension optionally subsetted in its list of members. When mapped to its physical source, a
 * CubeRegion contains data cells iden tified by the member combinations of the Cartesian product of the CubeRegion's
 * associated Dimensions and Measures. The relative ordering of CubeDeployment classes optionally implies a desi red
 * order of selection of the CubeDeployments, based on implementation-specific considerations (e.g., optimized access of
 * aggregate data). Synonyms: Sub-Cube, Partition, Slice, Region, Area. Misc. notes: 1. A CubeRegion is not a Cube, and
 * a Cube is not a CubeRegion. 2. A Cube has a Measure and CubeRegion may have a corresponding measure (Measures are
 * Attributes). 3. A Cube may or may not have CubeRegions. 4. If a Cube does not have a CubeRegion, then it's not
 * physically mapped (it's virtual). All physical mapping is based on the CubeRegion , not the Cub e.
