/**
 * TypeSystem class proxy interface. Instances of the TypeSystem class collect together the data types (subclasses of

 * other TypeSystems. TypeMapping instances collected by a TypeSystem instance include both those in which the software
 * system?s data types act as sources and as targets of mappings. Classifiers and TapeMappings are maintained in a
 * single collection via the ElementOwnership association but can be distinguished by their respective types. Because it
 * is a Package, a TypeSystem can also serve to collect together the C lassifier instances for a particular software
 * system.
