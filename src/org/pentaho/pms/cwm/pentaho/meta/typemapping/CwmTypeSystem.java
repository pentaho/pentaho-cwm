 * TypeSystem object instance interface. Instances of the TypeSystem class collect together the data types (subclasses

 * software system?s data types act as sources and as targets of mappings. Classifiers and TapeMappings are maintained
 * in a single collection via the ElementOwnership association but can be distinguished by their respective types.
