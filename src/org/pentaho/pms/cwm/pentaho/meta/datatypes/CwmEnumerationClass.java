/**
 * Enumeration class proxy interface. The Enumeration class is intended as a starting point from which enumerated data
 * types can be created. An enumerated data type is a collection of identifiers often used as the permitted states that
 * some other attribute or property of the enumerated type may take. The isOrdered attribute of an Enumeration instance
 * is used to determine if t he ordered constraint on the EnumerationLiterals association is relevant for the e
 * numeration. The particular ordering of EnumerationLiteral instances is ob tained from the ordered constraint on the
 * association even if the value attr ibutes of the EnumerationLiteral instances contain non-null values that might be
 * us ed to determine ordering. This is done to provide more flexible ordering semantics. An instance of Enumeration is
 * also required to create a range data type. Ref er to the EnumerationLiteral class for details.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
