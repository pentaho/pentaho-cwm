/**
 * Union object instance interface. The Union class represents programming language unions and similarly structured data
 * types. Because of the diversity of union semantics found across software systems, the Union and UnionMember classes
 * are likely candidates for specialization to better capture union semantics in specific language extension packages. A
 * discriminated Union has a collection of UnionMembers that determine the sets o f contents that the Union may contain.
 * Such Unions have an attribute called th e discriminator that identifies the memberCase value of the UnionMember that
 * the Uni on currently contains. The discriminator is found via the UnionDiscriminator association to
 * StructuralFeature. The discriminator may be embedded withi n UnionMembers or may be located outside the
 * discriminator. If it is locate d within UnionMembers, the discriminator should occur in every UnionMember at the same
 * location (often, the first). Undiscriminated unions (for example, a C language union) are also supported, but have an
 * empty discriminator reference, and the memberCase attribute of the Un ionMembers it contains is ignored.
 * Undiscriminated Unions are often used to represent alternate views of a single p hysical storage area. A fine degree
 * of control over this aspect of Unions may be obtaine d by creating a class that derives from both UnionMember and
 * FixedOffsetField (in the CWM Record package) and setting the offset attribute instances of that class accordingly.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
