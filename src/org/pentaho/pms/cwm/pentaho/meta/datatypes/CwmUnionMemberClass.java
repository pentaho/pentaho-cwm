/**
 * UnionMember class proxy interface. UnionMembers are described as features of a Union and each represents one of the
 * members of a Union. Note, however, that multiple case values can map to a single UnionMember. If isDefault is true,
 * the union member is the default member. UnionMember instances are allowed to have a memberCase and be the default
 * case. UnionMember instances often represent structured storage areas. A particular UnionMember may be associated with
 * a Classifier that describ es its internal structure via the StructuralFeatureType association (defined in the
 * ObjectModel::Core package). For example, the Record::Group class, itself a Classifier, can be used as the type of a
 * UnionMember in a manner co mpletely analogous to how it is used to describe the type of a structured field (see the
 * instance diagrams in the Record metamodel chapter for details).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>

  /**
   * Creates an instance object having attributes initialized by the passed values.
   * 
   * @param name
   *          An identifier for the ModelElement within its containing Namespace.
   * @param visibility
   *          Specifies extent of the visibility of the ModelElement within its owning Namespace.
   * @param ownerScope
   *          Specifies whether the Feature appears in every instance of the Classifier or whether it appears only once
   *          for the entire Classifier.
   * @param changeability
   *          Specifies whether the value may be modified after the object is created.
   * @param multiplicity
   *          The possible number of data values for the feature that may be held by an instance. The cardinality of the
   *          set of values is an implicit part of the feature. In the common case in which the multiplicity is 1..1,
   *          then the feature is a scalar (i.e., it holds exactly one value).
   * @param ordering
   *          Specifies whether the set of instances is ordered. The ordering must be determined and maintained by
   *          Operations that add values to the feature. This property is only relevant if the multiplicity is greater
   *          than one.
   * @param targetScope
   *          Specifies whether the targets are ordinary Instances or are Classifiers.
   * @param initialValue
   *          An Expression specifying the value of the attribute upon initialization. It is meant to be evaluated at
   *          the time the object is initialized. (Note that an explicit constructor may supersede an initial value.)
   * @param memberCase
   *          Contains the value of the Union?s discriminator for this UnionMember.
   * @param isDefault
   *          Indicates if this UnionMember is the default member of the Union (implying that when unstated, the Union?s
   *          discriminator would assume this instance?s memberCase value).
   * @return The created instance object.
