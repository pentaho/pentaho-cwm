 * UnionMember object instance interface. UnionMembers are described as features of a Union and each represents one of
 * the members of a Union. Note, however, that multiple case values can map to a single UnionMember. If isDefault is
 * true, the union member is the default member. UnionMember instances are allowed to have a memberCase and be the
 * default case. UnionMember instances often represent structured storage areas. A particular UnionMember may be
 * associated with a Classifier that describ es its internal structure via the StructuralFeatureType association
 * (defined in the ObjectModel::Core package). For example, the Record::Group class, itself a Classifier, can be used as
 * the type of a UnionMember in a manner co mpletely analogous to how it is used to describe the type of a structured
 * field (see the instance diagrams in the Record metamodel chapter for details).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
