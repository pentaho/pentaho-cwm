/**
 * EnumerationLiteral class proxy interface. EnumerationLiteral instances describe the enumeration identifiers, and
 * possibly the values, associated with an enumerated data type. Enumeration identifier s are contained in the name
 * attribute derived from the EnumerationLiteral instance?s Mo delElement superclass. EnumerationLiteral instances may
 * also be used to define expression-base d values such as ranges. To do so, simply state the membership expression in
 * the instance?s value. For example, a range literal can be created by setting the value attribute to "m..n", where m
 * represents the lower bound of the range, and n, the upper bound. In this way, ranges and other more complicated exp
 * ressions can be intermixed with simple enumeration literals. For example, an enumeration might contain the lit erals
 * "1", "2", "4..7", and "> 10". Consequently, a simple range data type can be created with an Enumerati on instance
 * that owns a single EnumerationLiteral instance. For example, a data type for positive integers could be created as
 * shown in the following instance diagram. A model attribute of this data type might then be declared as "po sInt :
 * PositiveInteger".
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
