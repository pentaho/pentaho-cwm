 * Email class proxy interface. An Email instance identifies a single email address. Via a Contact instance, an email
 * address can be associated with one or more ResponsibleParty instances. Email instances might, for example, be used by
 * an automated tool to send an automatically generated email message to a ResponsibleParty instance responsible about
 * some change of state for a particular ModelElement. Multiple Email instances may be associated with a single Contact
 * instance and the ordering of the association between them may be used to represent the sequence in which the Email
 * instances should be contacted. Because email addresses are first class objects within the CWM, they can be u sed for
 * purposes beyond those associated with the CWMFoundation?s Business Infor mation concepts.
