 * Email object instance interface. An Email instance identifies a single email address. Via a Contact instance, an
 * email address can be associated with one or more ResponsibleParty instances. Email instances might, for example, be
 * used by an automated tool to send an automatically generated email message to a ResponsibleParty instance responsible
 * about some change of state for a particular ModelElement. Multiple Email instances may be associated with a single
 * Contact instance and the ordering of the association between them may be used to represent the sequence in which the
 * Email instances should be contacted. Because email addresses are first class objects within the CWM, they can be u
 * sed for purposes beyond those associated with the CWMFoundation?s Business Infor mation concepts.
