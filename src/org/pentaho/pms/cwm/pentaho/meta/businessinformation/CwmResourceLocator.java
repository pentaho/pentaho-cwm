 * ResourceLocator instance could refer to anything from a location within a building
 * ("Room 317, third file cabinet, 2nd drawer") to a web location ("www.omg.org"). Because they are first class objects
 * in the CWM, ResourceLocator instances may also be used for purposes beyond those associated with the CWM Foundation's
 * B usiness Information concepts.
