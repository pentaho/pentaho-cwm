 * could refer to anything from a location within a building ("Room 317, third file cabinet, 2nd drawer") to a web
 * location ("www.omg.org"). Because they are first class objects in the CWM, ResourceLocator instances may also be used
 * for purposes beyond those associated with the CWM Foundation's B usiness Information concepts.
