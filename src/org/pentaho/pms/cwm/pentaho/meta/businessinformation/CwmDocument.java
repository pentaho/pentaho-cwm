/**
 * Document object instance interface. The Document class represents externally stored descriptive information about
 * some aspect of the modeled system. An instance of Document might be associated with one or more ModelElements. The
 * name of a Document instance is derived from its superclasses. Although the purposes of the Description and Document
 * types may overlap somewhat, their chief distinction is that Description instances are sto red with the CWM metadata
 * whereas Documentation instances are stored externall y to the CWM metadata. Although there is an implication here
 * that Documentat ion instances might represent more voluminous information than Descriptio n instances, there is no
 * particular requirement that this be so. Because Documentation instances are themselves Namespace instances, hier
 * archical relationships between various externally stored documents can be represented.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented 
 * by MDR (see <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">mdr.netbeans.org</a>).</em>
