/**
 * ResponsibleParty class proxy interface. The ResponsibleParty class allows representation of entities within an
 * information system that are in some way interested in receiving information about, or are otherwise responsible for,
 * particular ModelElements. Each ResponsibleParty may own multiple sets of contact information, and a single
 * ResponsibleParty may be associated with many ModelElements. ResponsibleParty instances may represent any entity
 * appropriate to the system being modeled and need not be limited to people. For example, a Respo nsibleParty instance
 * might represent an individual such as "George Washi
 * ngton", a role (the "President"), or an organization ("Congress"), depending upon the needs of the system being
 * modeled. Similarly, the precise semantics of the responsibility attribute are open to intrepretation and may be adapt
 * ed on a system-by-system basis. Because ResponsibleParty instances are Namespaces, they can be organize d into
 * hierarchies of ResponsibleParty instances, capturing organizational s tructures or similar relationships.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em><strong>Note:</strong> This type should not be subclassed or implemented 
 * by clients. It is generated from a MOF metamodel and automatically implemented
