/**
 * Contact object instance interface. Each Contact instance collects together the various types of related contact
 * information. Each Contact instance can be associated with multiple Email, Location and Telephone instances.
 * Conversely, each Email, Location, ResourceLocator and Telephone instance can be associated with many Contact
 * instances. The ordering constraints on the associations between these classes and the Contact class can be used to
 * represent a prioritized sequence in which the various types of contact information should be used. A particular
 * ResponsibleParty instance may have multiple instances of Contact associated with it via the ResponsiblePartyContact
 * association. This asso ciation is ordered to support representation of the sequence in which Contact instan ces
 * should be used. For example, a ResponsibleParty instance representing an employee might be associated with Contact
 * instances representing the ir office, home, and mobile contact information with an indication that the employee
 * should be contacted first at the office, then at home, and finally via their mobile phone. To maximize flexibility of
 * the metamodel, Contact instances may provide conta ct information for multiple ResponsibleParty instances.
