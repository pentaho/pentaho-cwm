/**
 * BusinessInformation package interface. The Business Information package depends on the following package:
 * org.omg::CWM::ObjectModel::Core The Business Information Metamodel provides general purpose services ava ilable to
 * all CWM packages for defining business-oriented information about m odel elements. The business-oriented services
 * described here are designed to support t he needs of data warehousing and business intelligence systems; they are no
 * t intended as a complete representation of general purpose business inte lligence metamodel. Business Information
 * Metamodel services support the notions of responsib le parties and information about how to contact them,
 * identification of off-l ine documentation and support for general-purpose descriptive information. Three CWM c lasses
 * "anchor" these services: ResponsibleParty, Document and Description, respectively. To aid in representing the
 * diversity of organizational structures and do cumentation relationships that may be encountered in a business
 * intelligence system, the metamodel provides robust relationships between the anchor classes and eve ry model element
 * in the CWM metamodel. The necessary robustness is achieved in several ways. First, every CWM model element may have
 * zero or more instances of each a nchor class associated with it. This means, for example, that a single Descri ption
 * instance can be used to describe many different model elements. Conversely, a si ngle model element may be described
 * by many different Description instances . Likewise, Document and ResponsibleParty instances can be associated in
 * completely ad hoc ways with any model element. Extending this idea means , for example, that Description instances
 * could be used to further describ e ResponsibleParty and Document instance, if needed. Second, because they are
 * Namespaces, the anchor classes can be organized into hierarchies using the ElementOwnership association. For
 * instance, an or ganizational structure can be represented by a hierarchy of ResponsibleParty instances . Also, the
 * internal structure of a document (i.e., its chapters, sections, subsections, etc.) might be represented by a
 * hierarchy of Document inst ances. Finally, instances of the three anchor classes can be associated with an y model
 * element (via their individual associations to ModelElement) and refer enced by multiple instances of any of the three
 * anchor classes. Because of the strong containment of the ElementOwnership association in the ObjectModel, anchor
 * class instances can only participate in one hierarchy, but there are no restrictions preventing anchor class
 * instances embedded in a hierarchy fr om referencing, or being referenced by, other model elements (even other m
 * embers of the same hierarchy). To illustrate some of the ways that the metamodel can be used, the follo wing figure
 * shows a simple document hierarchy with responsibility assignments and descriptive comments (boxes represent instances
 * of metamodel classes and labelled lines represent metamodel associations connecting instances). In the examp le, the
 * product plan document for the Widget product is composed of thre e subplans: a marketing plan, an engineering plan,
 * and a resource plan. T he relationships between the subplans documents is shown as a hierarchy wi th the product plan
 * owning the three subordinate plans via the ElementOwnershi p association. Each part of the plan is assigned to a
 * reponsible party u sing the ModelElementResponsibility association. Finally, Description i nstances are used to
 * record roles for the responsible parties. OCL Representation of BusinessInformation Constraints [C-3-1] A Description
