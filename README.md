# pentaho-cwm #
Pentaho Common Warehouse Metamodel

#### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* Maven, version 3+
* Java JDK 11
* This [settings.xml](https://github.com/pentaho/maven-parent-poms/blob/master/maven-support-files/settings.xml) in your <user-home>/.m2 directory

#### Building it

__Build for nightly/release__

All required profiles are activated by the presence of a property named "release".

```
$ mvn clean install -Drelease
```

This will build, unit test, and package the whole project (all of the sub-modules). The resulting jar file
artifact will be generated in: ```pentaho-cwm/target```

__IntelliJ__

* Don't use IntelliJ's built-in maven. Make it use the same one you use from the commandline.
  * Project Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven ==> Maven home directory
